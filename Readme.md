# This isn't a repository! This is my brain in nutshell.

I am an electronics engineer, I have been learning a lot of things in my journey of becoming an engineer, and the problem with that is, I have been confused and really dont know what I am doing in my life, due to few reasons, I have immersed myself in frontend, Backend and mobile app development. I jumped into AI, working on few kaggle example and learning few stuffs, it didnt go well, then I jumped into golang(built a LoRaWAN dcalpwan server for money obviously) and again I jumped into AI to support my team, then again into backend and yada yada yada...The story continues.

For a day, I thought I have just lost hope and I am good for nothing(Actually I think the same till now), Now why am I writing this?? what is the use of this and if its not a repository then what in the hell is this. 

Well you dont wait for people to come and help you(Introvert things: you bottle up problems and explode), well this is my path to redemption, path to find myself amidst the ego that I know everything.

> **_NOTE:_** There is a lot of ego involved when you try to learn something, while you are expert in another. In my case learning AI while having exceptional knowledge in IoT and Embedded. You think you would know about that just like that, but how could that be, if you know nothing about it. Also there will be a lot pressure over you because the world is adapting ai and you are still left behind, it develops a lot arrogance in you.

<mark>Izanami: So this is your rant page

Sorry no, You get yourself in a place, where you think you are just burden on others, and whatever you do, it will not change. well there is a twist, you become a people pleaser, you would equip skills just to solve the problem, basically I would learn things in one night and solve the problem and then I just forget what I do, In various places I did that because I wanted to feel speacial, maybe I wanted to feel valued or irreplacable(maybe that's the word). 

<mark>Izanami: but, why would you even go that far, why do you crave that irreplacability.

I crave expertise, I can implement solution for even the complex problems in IoT, but not in AI and people as of 2023, 2024 need AI. AI this AI that. I felt my skills isn't enough. to answer your question. That was becasue of my personal life.

I had few setbacks, and started questioning my existence. I thought maybe, maybe If I become something, they would understand my worth. But neither did I do something great to be in a place and never did they thought I was special. Maybe It was my fault, I am sure it was my fault, who would .............a person like me with only scattered thoughts, clumsy brain 
Izanami: Hello hello Helloooooo, we are not here for personal stuffs, get back to point.

Yeah, sorry!! yeah so ego, your ego stops you from taking efforts and decision to do new things, learn new skills. so mayeb you should put a fight right, no you can't you will lose(for sure). I felt lost, maybe confused or maybe ready to giveup. dont know, I got more work in differnt technologies mobile application, backend and back to round 1(square 0)........AIIIIIIIIIIII.

For a time, I decided I am not fit for it, I should just end myself, there is not reason for you to live if you cant even be a part of making even a small change in the environment. I have lost everything at that point, friends, family, collegues, mentors, brothers. sisters. I have been through this feeling in my life for several times, but this was different. previously I had no hope in the first place, this was different. I had a hope and I lost it.

<mark>Izanami: I am sure, this is your rant page

Sorry...This is my challenge for a one last time' a 60 days challenge. I am starting from Zero and would try to connect everything I know in this 60 days.

My plan is simple: I am a college student for next 60 days and I know nothing about tech, what all the skills I would pickup in this 60 days to become a CV engineer(goal 1) and what would be my transitions skills if I wish to adapt myself into GenAI stuffs.

Objectives:
- Learn things from scratch python, pandas, numpy, data analysis, data understanding
- learn basic ML algorithms and the math behind them(classification, clustering, dimensionality deduction)
- learn image classificaation, segmentation, detection and pose estimation basics of CV
- use this roadmap as refernce: https://pclub.in/roadmap/2024/08/17/cv-roadmap/
- Learn cv models, cnn architecture
- build few application
- learn generative models

On top of all, create contents from what ever you are learning and sum them up into a roadmap to CV engineer.

<mark>Izanami: best of luck, today is Day 1.

Izanami is a character from a japanese literature, she is the goddess of creation and death. I thought it would be cool to have a character like that in my brain.
